# Share Android Project to GitHub

## Objective
Practice Git Version Control using Android Studio

In this project you will create a new Android Project, then publish it as a public repository on GitHub. Before then, make sure you already have Android Studio installed (download here: [Mac](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/install/2.2.2.0/android-studio-ide-145.3360264-mac.dmg) [Windows](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/install/2.2.2.0/android-studio-bundle-145.3360264-windows.exe) [Linux](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/studio/ide-zips/2.2.2.0/android-studio-ide-145.3360264-linux.zip)) and a registered GitHub account (register [here](https://github.com/)). If you are ready, **let's get started!**
